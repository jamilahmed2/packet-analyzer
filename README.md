# Usage Instructions
# Prerequisites:
Python 3: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from here.

scapy Library: This tool uses the scapy library to capture and analyze network packets. To install it, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install scapy
Running the Packet Sniffer:
Download or Clone the Repository: Clone the repository or download the packet_sniffer.py file to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-sniffer.git
Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Run the script with the following command (using sudo for elevated permissions, which are often required for packet sniffing):

bash
Copy code
sudo python packet_sniffer.py
Input Network Interface: The script will prompt you to enter the network interface to sniff on (e.g., eth0, wlan0). Press Enter to use the default interface.

View Captured Data: Once running, the script will display information about each packet it captures, including:

Source and destination IP addresses.
Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
Payload data (if available and decodable).
Stopping the Sniffer: To stop packet sniffing, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.
